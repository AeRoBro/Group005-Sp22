	    "When first looking at the data we wanted to be able to implement what we've learned in class. Knowing this we wanted to predict any type of actions, and were lucky enought to find data on app ratings, and with this our goal is to predict app ratings. The data represents ratings of apps in the google play store by looking at all unique apps and their respective rating. We will wrangle the data allowing us to ultimately use linear regression using ordinary least squares to predict ratings for apps. Performance will be measured using a test/cost function."

	    "\n",
	    "As our daily routines depend more on mobile apps, apps with high ratings can suggest different meanings like how entertaining apps are or how helpful they are in our lives. Certain apps may become more popular as users give higher ratings, and people are more willing to download and use apps with higher ratings. Different models have been used to predict app ratings, such as Random Forest Regressor or XGboost models used to predict Google Apps Rating in this dataset<a name=\"houd\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#houdnote). Such predictions take into account of areas like app category, price, content rating, number of installs, or reviews to see what features influence the ratings more. An area of ongoing research in machine learning is natural language processing, which is a field that uses algorithms for detecting words in sentences and interpreting the semantics behind the way the words were phrased. Natural language processing could potentially be used to analyze app ratings when considering users' reviews, but not much has actually been done to determine how "good" or how high of a rating the application deserves based on the pattern between the words used in reviews and the rating given <a name=\"lutkevich\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#lutkevichnote). Linear regression is one of the most popular and most widely used algorithms. Being one of the oldest techniques, we can also say that it is one of those algorithms which have been studied immensely to understand and implement. Hence you will find a million different implementations and names for Linear Regression<a name=\"pandey\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#pandeynote)."

	    "\n",
	    "The problem we are solving is predicting an app's rating, which is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable, by analyzing which components of an app predict/impact its rating more accurately as well as to what degree. By figuring out these, we can understand the features that constitute to an app's success and hence eliminate aspects of an app that drag down its ratings. Predictions of app ratings are quantifiable and measurable as they are measured in a mathematical scale. It is replicable because we can calculate the ratings based on differences in an app's features. Some ML-relevant potential solutions are Ordinary Least Squares, one-hot encoding, data wrangling, linear regression, and other Python functions."

	    "The solution we will be implementing to reach our goal is ultimately using Ordinary Least Squares. In order to implement this we will have to follow distinct steps; creating a weight vector, in which we would have to calculate the optimum w that yields the minimum loss and taking the gradient. Something that will help us analyze the code is one-hot encoding, where we will have to transform categorical data to numerical to allow further analysis. After completing this, with other types of wrangling, we will implement linear regression creating a function that follows the mathematical computation. Some function calls that we will be implementing are numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn to compare different features that affect app ratings to ultimately see what variable has the highest correlation."
