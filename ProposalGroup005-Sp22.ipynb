    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",

    "When first looking at the data we wanted to be able to implement what we've learned in class. Knowing this we wanted to predict any type of actions, and were lucky enought to find data on app ratings, and with this our goal is to predict app ratings. The data represents ratings of apps in the google play store by looking at all unique apps and their respective rating. We will wrangle the data allowing us to ultimately use linear regression using ordinary least squares to predict ratings for apps. Performance will be measured using a test/cost function."
